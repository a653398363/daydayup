  <summary>
    Today no such severe lack exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to the signals of the infant, whose brain is programmed to learn language rapidly. If these sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. A bird learns to sing and to fly rapidly at the right time, but the process is slow and hard once the critical stage has passed.

    The reason some children are backward in speaking is most probably that ________.

    [A] they are incapable of learning language rapidly
    [B] they are exposed to too much language at once
    [C] their mothers respond inadequately to their attempts to speak
    [D] their mothers are not intelligent enough to help them

  </summary>

1. severe 严重的
2. backward 向后的
3. insensitive 不敏感的
4. infant 婴儿
5. neglect 忽视
6. incapable 无能力的
7. inadequately 不足的
